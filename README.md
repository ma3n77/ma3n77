## Hi there 👋
I’m a 4th year Computer Science student at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST),
passionate about building scalable and user-focused web applications.

My primary focus is software engineering, with strong interest in clean architecture, performance, and 
writing maintainable code. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working products.

🔨 What I’m Currently Working On -> 
- Learning and building projects with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- Strengthening my backend fundamentals and API development skills
- Improving my understanding of system design and scalable web architecture
- Building real-world responsive web applications

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind

Backend (Learning & Practicing):
Node.js, Express.js

Database:
MongoDB

Other Tools:
Git & GitHub
REST APIs
